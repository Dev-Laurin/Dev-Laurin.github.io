I'm a full stack software developer that has experience working with clients, beautifying websites, and maintaining/refactoring others' code. I've created small web apps from scratch for various projects, fixed computers, solved workflow/efficiency issues, and more. 

On a daily basis I analyze current practices and seek to improve them through software and custom software for the entire workplace.
