With crypto hitting peak popularity in 2021 and 2022 (before the big crypto scam reveal) I wanted to create my own coin based off my dog who recently passed away. She happened to be a shiba inu, which happens to be the dog breed of choice for crypto coins. However, besides just creating 'LissaCoin (my doggo's name was Alissa but we called her 'Lissa' often) I wanted to learn about the foundation of crypto itself: the blockchain. Thus the creation of dogchain, my own blockchain for the purposes of self-education as well as immortalization of my beloved childhood friend.
