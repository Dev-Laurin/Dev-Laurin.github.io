Many developers start out creating small games, I'm no exception. In high school I was creating my own versions of Mario, Pacman, etc. However I wanted to create something bigger for several years. I developed characters, their personalities, looks, etc in high school. I jotted down gameplay ideas for years during and post college. During the pandemic lockdowns, I finally began creating my dream game: A 3D Zelda-like world with an invisible spiritual world. My favorite games have mostly all been in 3D: Mario Sunshine, Mario Galaxy 1 & 2, Breath of the Wild, Wind Waker, Harvest Moon. 

In 2020 I began learning Unity. With the help of the Brackeys youtube channel I slowly became familiar with the popular game engine. I also began learning about shaders, which I found is a feat of itself. 

In 2021 I began learning modeling, and was still trying to pinpoint what I was going for in the story and for gameplay. 

In 2022 I found Thomas Brush and learned what I was doing wrong: 
1. I had no design document - therefore I was creating without knowing what I was supposed to be creating. The worst nightmare for a programmer trying to program - you can't think creatively and program it at the same time. The design needs to come first. 
2. I needed to create a small polished version of my game showing what it was all about, not start creating the entire thing. And I needed to get feedback on that small polished version to see if the game was interesting to others. 

So I began taking these steps and it has helped push the project from the 'start but never finish' stage. So far I have: 
1. Inventory & Inventory UI 
2. Quick Inventory / Equipment Selection 
3. Weather
4. Ocean / Water 
5. Third Person Character Controller & Camera 
6. Pickup Items 
7. Hunger / Thirst / Strength Depletion & UI 
8. Read NPC Dialogue
9. Take damage from Enemy 

I'm working on creating: 
1. Fully rigged 3D character 
2. Affinity system (at least with party members)
3. Combat 
4. Swimming
5. Climbing 
6. Sailing / Boating 
7. Puzzles 
8. Camping (to fill Hunger, Strength needs)
9. Armor / Clothing effects 

Among other things...

## Character Modeling
Here's some progress on the character modeling - which is very time consuming and I have a huge respect for 3D artists.
