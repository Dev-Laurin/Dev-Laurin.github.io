While working for RCS we had clients approach us about creating a low-no cost method to collect citizen science data through the web. They already had their Google site created and just need their forms converted to webforms and their data accessible from a spreadsheet. 

I ended up creating a Google Web App, since it was free, and embedded the webforms into their site.

Then I created a nice Map with graphs to show the data given by each site.

By using the sliders to change the date range, the graphs update to show each category the current chosen plant has for its berries. For example: Sept 3 2019 - Plant Name: Planty - 3 berries were rotten. This was half of the pie because there were only 6 berries to begin with. 

Overall the clients are still using this to collect citizen science data all across Alaska, without paper forms.
