It's funny how this project started out. First I applied for a job at the Geophysical and was denied. However they reached out to me for the opportunity to create this mobile app instead. 

This app uses a scientific model to predict where the permafrost is under ground using measurable values like air temperature and organic layer thickness. The model was already created in a python program by researchers at the Geophysical Institute, I merely had to re-write it into Swift and make an app out of it. 

It's currently on the Apple App Store and even has my name in the info section. 

It works by a user dragging the layers to the desired heights and the calculation operates on the fly to give you the Active Layer Thickness and Mean Annual Ground Temperature.

The user can also enter values for specific areas and save them for later (or instead of dragging enter exact number values to be calculated).

All in all the client was satisfied with the results and showed it off at a conference or two. I was excited to have finished my first independent contract job and first published App.
